## Challenge

The Manchester United FC aims to launch its new FinTech project: It involves a platform 
that enables users to purchase a fan token called MUFC. 

Users can utilize this token to acquire tickets to the Old Trafford museum, 
tours, match tickets, and it can also be exchanged for merchandise in the club store. 
To drive this project forward, they decide to hire two software engineers (one front-end 
and one back-end). The platform should possess the following features:

The platform must have an user registration system where personal data such as 
 - Name 
 - Surname
 - date of birth
 - country 
 - city
 -  full address, 
 - and other necessary information are stored. 

Additionally, the user should be able to recover their password 
if forgotten and must have 2FA. 

If a user registers with another user's referral code, 
 will receive 5 MUFC.

If the user is under 35 years old, they receive 10 MUFC as a welcome gift; 
if they are older, they receive 5 MUFC.

Each MUFC has a cost of 3 British pounds. 
Users can purchase them using a credit card.  

The main dashboard, once the user registers, allows the following actions: 

1. Purchase MUFC.
2. Gift MUFC to another user.
3. Obtain their referral code.
4. Check balance.
5. Recharge balance in MUFC.
6. View transaction history.
